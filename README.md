## ZZZ Finished Booting Skill
Skill to determine when Mycroft AI has finished booting up.

## Description 
A more verbose description, including any extra instructions or
information that didn't fit in the one line.
Mycroft loads the skills alphabetically (apart from the prioritized
skills) so this skill is named such that it should always be the last
skill to load. When this skill loads it assumes it is the last skill
to load and announces that Mycroft has finished booting up.
